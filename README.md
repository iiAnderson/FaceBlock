# FaceBlock

A Chrome Extension which blocks phrases from posts! Built on request.
Phrases can be added to the blacklist via the popup for the extension.

Adds a extension on the top righthand side of the chrome window, which allows you to add
specific phrases to be blocked from your facebook timeline.

I would suggest you dont put HTML tags in as it may remove all posts in your stream!
